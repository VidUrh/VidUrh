### About Me

I am an experienced Python programmer with over 7 years of hands-on coding experience. Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in various domains, including web development, robotics, and artificial intelligence. My journey as a programmer began with web development, where I gained proficiency in PHP, JavaScript, and database systems. 

Driven by my curiosity and the desire to explore new frontiers, I transitioned into the field of robotics at RLS merilna tehnika d.o.o. As the sole Python developer in the department, I took on the responsibility of developing the software for a hardware testing device. This project equipped me with extensive knowledge of PyTest, test-driven development, technical documentation writing, and communication with hardware components.

Continuing my passion for robotics, I am currently engaged in a new project focusing on robot programming and the design of comprehensive software architectures. Additionally, I am responsible for developing a secure socket communication system with the control system, as well as creating a data collection and storage solution.

Beyond my professional work, I am an avid creator in my spare time. I have developed a range of intriguing projects, including a computer vision system for robotics, web scraping applications utilizing video and audio, and even delving into the realm of artificial intelligence with reinforcement learning.

1. [AutomateReddit](https://github.com/VidUrh/AutomateReddit#automate-reddit): This project is a Reddit video generator that retrieves posts from a specified subreddit and creates a video with text and images based on the post content.

2. [RobotVision](https://github.com/VidUrh/RobotVision): The robotic vision project where the challenge was detecting same object of multiple colors and picking them up with a robot.

3. [Personal website](https://vidurh.github.io/): A super simple static website hosted on github, featuring an outdated about me section, 2 simple games I built with javascript and a welcome section from 2018. Interesting for the games.
